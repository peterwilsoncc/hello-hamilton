This is not just a plugin, it takes and it takes a lyric from Hamilton the Musical to display on each page of your admin.

== Description ==

This is not just a plugin, it takes and it takes and it takes and we keep living anyway. We rise and we fall and we break and we make our mistakes. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from <cite>Hamilton the Musical</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.
